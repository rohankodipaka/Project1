           Ragging is a disturbing reality in the higher education system of our country.
"Ragging is any disorderly conduct, whether by words spoken or written, or by an act which has
the effect of teasing, treating or handling with rudeness any student, indulging in rowdy or
indisciplined activities which cause or are likely to cause annoyance, hardship or psychological
harm or to raise fear or apprehension thereof in a fresher or a junior student and which has the
effect of causing or generating a sense of shame or embarrassment so as to adversely affect the
psyche of a fresher or a junior student."
